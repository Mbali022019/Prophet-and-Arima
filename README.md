# ðŸ“Š Fashion Store Sales Forecasting â€“ ARIMA vs Prophet

This project applies time series forecasting techniques on a fashion store sales dataset.
It explores and compares two powerful forecasting models:

* ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
* Prophet (developed by Meta/Facebook)

The workflow covers the full data science project life cycle:

1. Data Upload & Extraction â€“ Upload and extract sales dataset
2. Data Understanding â€“ Explore dataset structure, handle missing values, duplicates
3. Data Preparation & Cleaning â€“ Convert datatypes, aggregate daily sales
4. Data Visualization â€“ Observe trends, seasonality, and outliers
5. ARIMA Forecasting â€“ Build and train ARIMA model
6. Prophet Forecasting â€“ Build and train Prophet model
7. Model Comparison â€“ Evaluate models using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE
8. Conclusion â€“ Summarize findings and insights

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* Python (Google Colab / Jupyter)
* Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `prophet`, `sklearn`

### ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

### ðŸš€ Key Highlights

* End-to-end time series forecasting pipeline
* Hands-on comparison of traditional statistical vs. modern ML-based forecasting
* Visualization of actual vs. predicted sales trends
